    <h1>Control</h1>
    <p id="content">
      The first concept down was creating the fictional FBC, a realistic setting
      that would serve as a basis for paranormal events and a catalyst for
      events in the story. This enabled them to consider multiple stories they
      could tell, not just about the player-character but other individuals in
      the FBC, but this also created the challenge of how to present the stories
      of the other characters in the open-world format. The gathered writings of
      the fictional SCP Foundation ("Secure, Contain, Protect") website was a
      major influence on Control. Stories on SCP Foundation's site are based on
      singular objects with strange paranormal impacts, and as a whole, they are
      narratively linked by the common format of reports written by the
      fictional SCP Foundation, which catalogs and studies the objects. Control
      was built atop this, having the various Objects of Power and Altered
      Items, along with numerous collectable writings about these objects or
      other stories in line with SCP. They fixed the story in the genre of the
      new weird, a modern variant of weird fiction with stories that combine
      science fiction and fantasy often with a bureaucratic government agency
      involved in these events. In Control, they reversed the role to make the
      bureaucracy at the center of the story. Narrative Designer Brooke Maggs
      stated "there is an invisible, assailing presence of bureaucracy in the
      corporate office setting that is in itself, unsettling". The mundane
      features of the Oldest House helped to contrast against the paranormal
      aspects of the game, thus well-suiting the new weird, according to World
      Design Director Stuart MacDonald. The design team's goal in using the new
      weird approach was not to create terrifying moments as one would do in a
      horror game, but instead create a continuing sense of dread for the
      player.
